My name is John Curtis Jr, and this is my term project for Information Technology 550. This class has been <strong>amazing</strong> and has further increased my knowledge with web programming that I will have to use in my technology career as I pursue my Master of Information and Library Science degree. I have no doubt this course will help me become a better web developer and contribute to my goal of maintaining my own web design company!</p>

<h1>More Info</h1>
	<br>
<p style="padding-bottom: 1%;"> My website is divided into several pages. Here, on the Home page, you will see a Navigation bar at the top of the page. Additionally, there is a little information about myself included below. The second page, called Info Tech, will go over some of the technology we learned about in this class. On the first sub-page under Info Tech, you can learn about websites and blogs that deal with Information Technology in libraries today. Under the second sub-page, you can learn all about Zenodo, my open-source tool of choice. You can also fill out a survey answering questions about it. Under the third sub-page, you can learn about ten great Open Source tools that are used in the library world today and rank them on a scale from 1-5 and view the results of the rankings. The third main page will tell you about my interests being DC Comics. The second sub-page under interests will tell you about popular DC Films... Make sure to hover over the pictures on the webpages for a suprise! (Dont't worry, it is nothing scary like those haunting pop-up videos on Facebook your friends or family have shown you) </p>
